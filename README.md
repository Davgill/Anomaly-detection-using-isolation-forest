# Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest
We would like to explore how machine learning algorithms are used to facilitate anomaly detection in network logs, easier, faster and accurate.

## Project Description

This project utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in network log data. It processes log files, extracts relevant features such as IP addresses, URLs, and user groups, and identifies unusual patterns that may indicate security threats or system errors.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Prepare your log data in CSV format.
2.  Run the anomaly detection script:
    ```bash
    python anomaly_detection.py --training_data train.csv --test_data test.csv
    ```
